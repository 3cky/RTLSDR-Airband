NEWS:

Version 2.3.0:
 * Added support for mixers. It is now possible to produce audio streams
   combined from several input channels. Both mono and stereo mixing is
   supported. Usage example is provided in config/mixers.conf. All
   mixer-related parameters are documented in config/reference.conf.
 * Added build options for 64-bit ARM architectures, like Odroid C2.
   Please use PLATFORM=armv8-generic when compiling.
 * Fixed a long-standing bug in RTL sample processing, which caused some
   samples to be processed twice. If you were annoyed by these regular
   clicks in NFM audio every 125 ms, they are now gone.
 * Reduced CPU usage on x86
 * Some code restructuring and cleanups
 * Added several configuration file examples for typical real-life
   scenarios. They are placed in config/ subdirectory. rtl_airband.conf.example
   file has been moved to config/reference.conf. It is meant to be a reference
   for all supported config knobs together with their description. This is
   still an interim solution before some more readable and understandable
   documentation gets written.

Version 2.2.0:
 * Support for Icecast stream metadata updates in scanning mode. When enabled,
   every time the scanner stops on a channel, current frequency is written into
   Icecast song title, which in turn is displayed in the player. Alternatively,
   textual labels can be configured for each frequency. It is possible
   to configure the amount of delay between the stream and metadata updates to
   synchronize them with the audio. There are some caveats however - read 
   comments in rtl_airband.conf.example for details.
 * Added global option 'localtime'. When enabled, rtl_airband uses local time 
   instead of UTC time for output file names. (Credit: ScanOC).
 * Auto gain feature removed. RTL auto gain does not work well for narrowband 
   channels. Most often it sets the gain too high which causes problems for 
   auto squelch and audio bleeding between adjacent channels. Gain must be 
   configured manually from now on.
 * Dropped unmaintained Windows build.
 * Reverted to power level calculation algorithm from version 2.0.2. The new
   algo didn't really do much to sensitivity, but introduced annoying clicks 
   on squelch open/close.
 * Improved DC offset estimator for AM mode. This one hardly ever clicks
   on squelch opening.
 * Boosted AM audio volume.
 * Reduced squelch flapping in NFM mode.

Version 2.1.0:
 * Narrowband FM demodulation support
 * Automatic Frequency Control
 * Append mode for recording (enabled by default)
 * Dongles, channels and outputs can be individually enabled and disabled
   by a simple config flag (no need to comment out or delete large
   configuration sections)
 * Use VBR for MP3 encoding
 * Modified power level calculation algorithm (better sensitivity)
 * Support for manual squelch setting
 * Bug fixes

Version 2.0.2:
 * Fixed a problem with running three dongles or more, simultaneously

Version 2.0.1:
 * Fixed crash on output initialization

Version 2.0.0:
 * New libconfig-style config file format
 * util/convert_cfg: can be used to convert old-style config.txt to the new format
 * Syslog logging (enabled by default)
 * Daemon mode
 * Reworked makefiles, added install rule
 * /dev/vcio is now used to access GPU on RPi; creating char_dev no longer necessary
 * Startup scripts for Debian and Gentoo
 * Support for auto gain setting
 * Support for multiple outputs per channel
 * Support for recording streams to local MP3 files
 * Support for ARMv7-based platforms other than RPi (eg. Cubieboard)
 * Updated documentation
 * Numerous bugfixes and stability improvements

Version 1.0.0:
 * Linux x86/x86_64 support (Windows build is currently unmaintained and might not work)
 * Raspberry Pi V2 support
 * Bundled hello_fft code (v2.0)
 * More robust interaction with Icecast servers
 * Important stability fixes
