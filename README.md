RTLSDR-Airband
=====================

This is a development branch of RTLSDR-Airband.

**NOTE: The program is now built with cmake. Building instructions from the Wiki do not apply to this branch. Please use the following procedure:**

- Install all required dependencies as per the Wiki.
- Install cmake and pkg-config:

```
apt-get install cmake pkg-config
```

- Clone the repository and switch to the `unstable` branch:

```
git clone https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband.git
cd RTLSDR-Airband
git checkout unstable
```

- Build the program as follows:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install
```

- The following options may be specified when running `cmake`:

  - `-DPLATFORM=<platform_name>` - optimize the build for the given hardware. `<platform_name>` might be one of: `rpiv1`, `rpiv2`, `armv7-generic`, `armv8-generic`, `native`.
  - `-DNFM=1` - enables narrow FM support (0 disables).
  - `-DRTLSDR=0 -DMIRISDR=0 -DSOAPYSDR=0 -DPULSEAUDIO=0` - disables respective SDR driver and/or feature. They are all enabled by default and will be built if necessary dependencies are detected.
  - `-DPROFILING=1` - enable profiling support with Google Perftools.

Example:

```
cmake -DPLATFORM=rpiv2 -DSOAPYSDR=0 -DPROFILING=1 ../
```

The Wiki will be updated once the new build system is declared stable and a new release is made.

=====================

**Current stable release: [3.2.1](https://github.com/szpajder/RTLSDR-Airband/releases/latest)** (released November 13, 2020)

RTLSDR-Airband receives analog radio voice channels and produces
audio streams which can be routed to various outputs, such as online
streaming services like LiveATC.net. Originally the only SDR type
supported by the program was Realtek DVB-T dongle (hence the project's
name). However, thanks to SoapySDR vendor-neutral SDR library, other
radios are now supported as well.
