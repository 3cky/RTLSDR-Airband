# Example configuration file for 2 dongles.
# First dongle - scanning mode, NFM modulation, three frequencies,
# output to Icecast stream and to a file.
# Second dongle - multichannel mode, three channels:
#
# - channel 1: AM, goes to Icecast stream
# - channel 2: AM, goes to two Icecast streams
# - channel 3: NFM, goes to two files
#
# Dongles are specified with their serial numbers instead of
# indexes, because the latter can change when devices are
# reconnected into different USB ports.
#
# Settings are described in reference.conf.
